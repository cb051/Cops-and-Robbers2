# Cops-and-Robbers2
This project builds on the previous project (Cops-and-Robbers) but now, when a cop car intersects with a robber, the robber goes to jail (the game reflects such). Another major difference: this project explores threads and thread synchronization. The cop and robber cars also bounce off of edges of the screen. Shortcuts still apply (right click to refill). Type 'javac Controller.java' then 'java Controller' to run program.
